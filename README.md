# Sustainability Impact Analysis – Intel Device Repurposing Program

## Overview
This project analyzes Intel’s global device repurposing program to evaluate **energy savings** and **CO2 reduction** by device type and region.  
The goal was to identify high-impact areas and propose cost-effectiveness improvements to maximize environmental and operational benefits.

## Objectives
- Evaluate sustainability metrics for Intel's device repurposing program.
- Identify **top contributing device types** and **regions** driving the most impact.
- Integrate **cost-per-device** analysis to prioritize high ROI sustainability actions.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** — For querying, aggregating, and analyzing device sustainability data.

## Key Insights
- Certain device categories consistently outperform others in both **energy savings** and **CO2 reduction**.
- Regional analysis revealed **disparities in adoption rates**, highlighting opportunities for focused engagement.
- Integrating cost-per-device metrics uncovered opportunities to **improve cost efficiency** without reducing impact.

## Results (Summary)
- Identified the top **3 device categories** with the highest sustainability returns.
- Recommended targeted repurposing efforts in **specific underperforming regions**.
- Proposed adding **cost-effectiveness KPIs** to the sustainability dashboard.

## Impact
This project aligns with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production**.  
By optimizing Intel’s device repurposing strategy, it helps:
- Reduce **e-waste**.
- Minimize **resource consumption**.
- Extend the lifecycle of electronic devices — supporting sustainable production and consumption practices.
