# Sustainability Impact Analysis – Intel Device Repurposing Program

## Overview
Analyzed **energy savings** and **CO2 reduction** by device type and region in Intel’s global device repurposing program using **SQL**.  
Identified key contributors to environmental impact and proposed cost-effective optimization strategies.  
Aligned project insights with **UN Sustainable Development Goal 12: Responsible Consumption and Production** to support reduced e-waste and sustainable resource use.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** — For querying, aggregating, and analyzing sustainability metrics.

## Key Findings
- Certain device types deliver **disproportionate sustainability benefits**.
- Regional adoption rates vary, presenting opportunities for targeted improvement.
- Incorporating **cost-effectiveness analysis** enhances decision-making for device repurposing.

## Impact
- Reduced **electronic waste** by extending device lifecycle.
- Minimized **resource consumption** and improved environmental footprint.
- Supported sustainable production and consumption practices.

## Repository Contents
- `intel_sustainability_analysis.sql` — SQL queries used for analysis.
- `README.md` — Project overview and documentation.
